    PhởCureBurn is a vision our dear friend Michelin once had. A vision
    where weary wanderers would find themselves chasing another type of art.
    Art that can be smelled, sought out, and enjoyed *somewhere* in deep playa.
    Together, 5 best friends decided it's time to bring this vision to Burning Man.

  title: What Is Our Mission?
  description: >
    We want to give the people of Black Rock City another home they came come back
    to and enjoy vietnamese iced coffee, spring rolls, and of course a bowl of pho.
    PhoCureBurn is a home for all of those looking for fun company, and tasty
    delights.
