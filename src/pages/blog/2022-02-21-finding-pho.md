description: "Pho is a Vietnamese soup that’s made with all the good stuff:
  broth, noodles, beef (or other protein) and lots of mix-and-match toppings.
  The best thing about pho is that it’s such a restorative food—the comforting
  soup is savory and rich, while still feeling clean and refreshing at the same
  time."
